<h2><a name="s-run-debian"></a>5.1 Smart Cache on Debian GNU/Linux</h2>

<p>
Smart Cache is default configured as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Smart Cache is started on system boot and runs under userid <em>proxy</em>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Configuration files are in <samp>/etc/scache/</samp>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
CacheRoot is <samp>/var/cache/scache/</samp>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Every day, Smart Cache is restarted and logs are rotated.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Every week Smart Cache performs garbage collection.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Smart Cache is restarted after establishing PPP connection
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
You do not need care about <a href="ch-bugs.html#s-dnsbug">Java DNS caching
bug/feature, Section 12.1</a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Logfiles are in /var/log/scache*.log.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s-running"></a>5.2 Running Smart Cache</h2>

<p>
Starting Smart Cache is easy:
</p>
<ol type="1" start="1" >
<li>
<p>
change your current directory to Smart Cache's home directory, where the
*.class files are in.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="2" >
<li>
<p>
execute the command <code>java -cp .  -ms1m scache</code>
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
If all works right Smart Cache starts and you will see something like this:
</p>

<pre>
     Smart Cache 0.41 - full featured caching proxy server and web forwarder
     Copyright (c) Radim Kolar 1998-9.  Open source software; There is NO warranty.
     See the GNU General Public License version 2 or later for copying conditions.
     
     Wed Sep 01 15:53:14 GMT+02:00 1999 Smart Cache 0.41 ready.
</pre>

<p>
If it do not works, read <a href="ch-troubles.html">Troubleshooting, Chapter
13</a>.
</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s-stopping"></a>5.3 Stopping Smart Cache/Shutdown flag</h2>

<p>
Smart Cache can be stopped following ways:
</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="s-killingsc"></a>5.3.1 Killing process</h3>

<p>
Probably most convient method.  Its also good for use in startup/shutdown
scripts.
</p>
<ol type="1" start="1" >
<li>
<p>
Killing Smart Cache process.  Please dont use hard kill (SIGKILL or kill -9) if
possible.  Smart Cache needs to sync <code>.cacheinfo</code> files before
exiting.  Use hard kill only if Smart Cache gets deadlocked.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="2" >
<li>
<p>
Closing Smart Cache window
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="3" >
<li>
<p>
Pressing CTRL-C in Smart Cache window
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h3><a name="s5.3.2"></a>5.3.2 Using flag file</h3>

<p>
Second method to stop Smart Cache is by creating flag file with name defined in
<code>scache.cnf</code>.  Flag file can be created on Unix systems with
<samp>touch &lt;filename&gt;</samp> command.  In Windows environment use for
example
</p>

<pre>
     echo &gt; c:\name\of\shutdown\flag     or
     mkdir  c:\name\of\shutdown\flag
</pre>

<p>
Flag file can have any content inside, Smart Cache checks only if some file
with specified filename exists.
</p>

<p>
You might use directory with specified name instead of file (this is easier to
create under Windows because its just one simple mkdir command).  If you are
using directory be sure not to place any files inside it because Smart Cache
will not be able to delete it on shutdown and on next start it will shutdown
again because flag directory still exists.
</p>
<ol type="1" start="1" >
<li>
<p>
If you want to shutdown cache after it becomes inactive use
<em>shutdown_flag</em> and <strong>wait about 3 minutes</strong>.  Smart Cache
will shutdown without interrupting anything.  If Smart Cache is still in use,
it will continue running and stops after 3 minutes of inactivity later.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="2" >
<li>
<p>
Smart Cache can make also 'fast shutdown'.  Configuration keyword
<samp>immediate_shutdown_flag</samp> is used for it.  Smart Cache checks
presence of this flag every <samp>flag_check_interval</samp> seconds.  Use this
if you do not want to wait for shutdown via flag too long.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h3><a name="s5.3.3"></a>5.3.3 Background information</h3>

<p>
Smart Cache updates every 3 minutes <samp>.cacheinfo</samp> files, which holds
information about directory contents.  If <samp>.cacheinfo</samp> is bad, no
(or some) files in directory with that <code>.cacheinfo</code> will be found.
</p>

<p>
If you look into SC output, you will see how many <code>.cacheinfo</code> files
were updated in message <em>XX - directories saved</em>.  If you see <samp>0
dirs saved</samp> and you are not using SC, no .cacheinfo contains out-of-date
information.
</p>

<p>
You can recreate <samp>.cacheinfo</samp> file by repair utility or more
convient way is to run <samp>scache -repair</samp>.
</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s-gc"></a>5.4 Running garbage collection</h2>

<p>
If your cache is getting large, you may want to run the <em>garbage
collection</em> process.  [<a href="footnotes.html#f4" name="fr4">4</a>] Smart
Cache never deletes something from its data directory, it only adds or
overwrites files.  You must run GC or use other software tools for freeing disk
space.
</p>

<p>
GC process scans the entire cache, finds old files and deletes them until
specified cache size is reached.  Detailed information in <a
href="ch-advancedt.html#s-gcworks">How garbage collection works, Section
7.3</a>.
</p>

<p>
Garbage collections also checks cache integrity, deletes unreferenced files,
empty directories and bad entries from <code>.cacheinfo</code> files.  This
check is the same as does -killunref procedure.  Edit the <code>gc.cnf</code>
file and run it with <samp>java scache -gc</samp>
</p>

<p>
Garbage collection can be run, while proxy server is still running, there is no
need for stopping it.  See also <a
href="ch-configuration.html#s-gcconf">Configuration of garbage collection,
Section 4.2</a> and <a href="#s-maint">Smart Cache maintenance, Section
5.5</a>.
</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s-maint"></a>5.5 Smart Cache maintenance</h2>

<p>
Smart Cache needs no special maintenance except <a href="#s-gc">Running garbage
collection, Section 5.4</a> and maintaining some free diskspace.
</p>

<p>
In some rare cases (mainly due to improper cache shutdown) there can be some
orphan files (files without any reference) in the cache.  These can be located
and deleted using the <samp>java scache -killunref</samp> command or located
and inserted back into cache (by creating reference for them) by <samp>java
scache -repair</samp>.  These files are very rare and takes very few diskspace
(in most installations about 0.1%) , so there is no need to worry about them.
</p>

<p>
Nowadays these commands are obsolete and has been replaced by the garbage
collector, which happily deletes them as part of his normal operation.  Use
these commands only if you want to repair cache without performing garbage
collection.  This operation is about 2-3 times faster than garbage collection.
</p>

<p>
Repair procedures summary:
</p>
<ol type="1" start="1" >
<li>
<p>
if you are short of diskspace use -gc
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="2" >
<li>
<p>
if you are using -gc you need not to run something else
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="3" >
<li>
<p>
if you are want to recover inaccessible files run -repair
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="4" >
<li>
<p>
if you want to see what files will gc delete without deleting them use -fakegc.
Very handy for fine tuning GC.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="5" >
<li>
<p>
do not use -killunref, it is just waste of time.  Repair or GC does much better
job.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="s-urlblock"></a>5.6 URL blocking</h2>

<p>
Smart Cache has a builtin URL filter.  This filter was designed to eliminate
ADV.  banners, because they slow down browsing a lot, and other unwanted stuff
which WWW browsers downloads without asking (for example .AVI files in web
pages.  Netscape downloads it even if do not have plugin for them.).
</p>

<p>
Filter comes in two flavours normal MS-DOS like regexp and full posix like
regexp.  Full regexp filter has higher priority than normal and is configured
in file <samp>rfail.cnf</samp>.
</p>

<p>
Normal filter in controlled by two <samp>fail.cnf</samp> and
<samp>pass.cnf</samp> configuration files.  In first file, you can find list of
BLOCKED URLs and list of UNBLOCKED in second.  Files has the same syntax -
write one URL mask per line, you can use wildchar '*' in expected way.  SC will
detects when you edit this files and reload it without needing to restart.
</p>

<p>
When SC gets request for a particular URL, it will look in
<samp>pass.cnf</samp> first.  If requested URL is one of them, SC will skip
following tests and displays it.  If requested URL is not found in
<samp>pass.cnf</samp> SC will look into <samp>fail.cnf</samp>.  If requested
URL is there, SC will abort request otherwise request will be allowed.
</p>

<p>
When SC encounters a blocked URL, error <strong>403 Forbidden by rule</strong>
will be displayed.  You can display any custom URL instead, many people uses
some images, which will appear on places of ADV.  banners.  You can use any
picture from net, SC will cache this, so it will not be downloaded more times.
</p>

<pre>
     ErrorDocument 403 http://some.site.with.nice.images.com/images/nature/bluesky.gif
</pre>

<p>
Other people likes blank image instead.  Famous 43 byte long 1x1 transparent
GIF is now hardcoded in SC and can be used with:
</p>

<pre>
     ErrorDocument 403 0
</pre>

<p>
In some cases you may got unwanted <strong>Forbidden by rule</strong> errors.
You have two choices for their eliminating:
</p>
<ol type="1" start="1" >
<li>
<p>
You can locate URL mask which causes the URL blocking and remove it from the
file.  (<samp>trace_fail yes</samp> helps, if in trouble)
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="2" >
<li>
<p>
Because this URL masks blocks also what you want to block (for example ADV.
Banners), You can add new mask to <samp>pass.cnf</samp> file which unlock
incorrectly blocked URL.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
<strong>Example:</strong> You want to access site http://ad.astra.com/, but you
can't do that because Smart Cache has a default entry http://ad.* in
<code>fail.cnf</code> file, which deny access to this server.  You do not want
to remove this entry from <code>fail.cnf</code>, because it unlocks many ADV.
banners.  Solution is add http://ad.astra.* to <code>pass.cnf</code> file.
</p>

<p>
You can also turn of announcing blocked URLs to console by directive
<samp>trace_fail</samp>.  This is useful if you are using a complex
&quot;fail.cnf&quot; with a lot of entries and can't fiddle out if or why some
request has been blocked.
</p>

<h2><a name="s-gui"></a>5.7 Smart Cache GUI</h2>

<p>
Smart Cache has a simple HTML user interface, which allows to search and browse
the cache content.  This UI is required if you want to use special offline
support features (hooks for Smart Cache Loader).  To enable it, add
<strong>ui_port 8081</strong> to <code>scache.cnf</code>.  After that point www
browser to http://127.0.0.1:8081/
