<h2>5.1 Smart Cache on Debian GNU/Linux</h2>

<p>
Smart Cache is default configured as follows:
<ul>
<li>
Smart Cache is started on system boot and runs under userid <em>proxy</em>.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
It uses TYA JIT compiler when available.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
Configuration files are in <samp>/etc/scache/</samp>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
CacheRoot is <samp>/var/cache/scache/</samp>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
Every day, Smart Cache is restarted and logs are rotated.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
Every week Smart Cache performs garbage collection.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
Smart Cache is restarted after establishing PPP connection
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
You do not need care about <a href="ch-bugs.html#s-dnsbug">Java DNS caching
bug/feature, Section 12.1</a>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
Logfiles are in /var/log/scache*.log.
</li>
</ul>

<a name="s-running"></a>
<h2>5.2 Running Smart Cache</h2>

<p>
If you installed the JRE1.1 start Java with <code>jre -cp .</code> command
instead only <code>java</code> .  If you are installed JDK1.3 or higher you can
add switch -server.  (Note: You can also make .jar file see <a
href="ch-prog.html#s-jar">Making Java 1.2+ .jar file, Section 10.1</a> and run
it by java -jar scache.jar or by double clicking on .jar file) All other
parameters remain the same.

<p>
Starting Smart Cache is easy:
<ol type="1" start="1" >
<li>
change your current directory to Smart Cache's home directory, where the
*.class files are in.
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="2" >
<li>
execute the command <code>java -ms1m scache</code>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
JDK1.1 Only: If you want to Smart Cache runs faster at cost of using more
memory -- Change -ms1m switch to something else.  See <a
href="ch-admins.html#s-bench">Proxy cache Benchmarks, Section 9.2</a>

<p>
If all works right Smart Cache starts and you will see something like this:

<pre>
     Smart Cache 0.41 - full featured caching proxy server and web forwarder
     Copyright (c) Radim Kolar 1998-9.  Open source software; There is NO warranty.
     See the GNU General Public License version 2 or later for copying conditions.
     
     Wed Sep 01 15:53:14 GMT+02:00 1999 Smart Cache 0.41 ready.
</pre>

<p>
If it do not works, read <a href="ch-troubles.html">Troubleshooting, Chapter
13</a>.

<a name="s-stopping"></a>
<h2>5.3 Stopping Smart Cache/Shutdown flag</h2>

<p>
If you have JDK version 1.3 or better you can skip this section.  Smart Cache
will always perform clean shutdown in this case.

<p>
This is somewhat obscure feature of SC.  You do not need to understand what it
does or even use it.  Smart Cache can be also stopped by CTRL-C, Closing
Window, Kill process or CTRL-ALT-DEL on newer Windows versions.

<p>
If you want to cleanly shutdown cache - just create a file (or directory) with
name as set in the <em>shutdown_flag</em> and <strong>wait about 3
minutes</strong>.  This makes clean shutdown of SC without interrupting
anything.  If Smart Cache is in use, it will continue running and stops after 3
minutes of inactivity.

<p>
Smart Cache can make also 'fast shutdown', which is still better than killing
the Smart Cache process (CTRL-C is also killing, because Java &lt; 1.3 can not
hook it), because it synces directories information and logfiles.
Configuration keyword <samp>immediate_shutdown_flag</samp> sets the name of
this flag file and keyword <samp>flag_check_interval</samp> sets, how often SC
checks for this flag.  Use this if you do not want to wait for normal cache
shutdown.

<p>
Flag file can be created on Unix systems with <samp>touch
&lt;filename&gt;</samp> command, in Windows environment use for example

<pre>
     echo &gt; c:\name\of\shutdown\flag     or
     mkdir     c:\name\of\shutdown\flag
</pre>

<p>
Flag file is nothing special, SC checks only if some file with specified
filename exists.  Directory with specified name can be also used (this is
easier to create under Windows).

<hr>

<a name="s5.3.1"></a>
<h3>5.3.1 Background information</h3>

<p>
Smart Cache updates every 3 minutes <samp>.cacheinfo</samp> files, which holds
information about directory contents.  If .cacheinfo is bad, no/some files in
directory will not be found, but you can recreate them by repair utility.  If
you look into SC output, you will see how many .cacheinfo files was updated in
message <em>XX - directories saved</em>.  If you see <samp>0 dirs saved</samp>
and you are not using SC, no .cacheinfo contains out-of-date information, so
you can kill SC process without harming anything.  Also if you are just
browsing offline, only outdated information in .cacheinfo files is Last Access
Date, which is used only by GC, so killing SC will not harm your data.

<hr>

<a name="s-gc"></a>
<h2>5.4 Running garbage collection</h2>

<p>
If your cache is getting large, you may want to run the <em>garbage
collection</em> process.  [<a href="footnotes.html#f5" name="fr5">5</a>] Smart
Cache never deletes something from its data directory, you must run GC or use
other software tools for freeing disk space.

<p>
GC process scans the entire cache, finds old files and deletes them until
specified cache size is reached.  Detailed information in <a
href="ch-advancedt.html#s-gcworks">How garbage collection works, Section
7.3</a>.

<p>
Garbage collections also checks cache integrity, deletes unreferenced files,
empty directories and bad entries from .cacheinfo files.  This check is the
same as does -killunref procedure.  Edit the <code>gc.cnf</code> file and run
it with <samp>java scache -gc</samp>

<p>
Garbage collection can be run, while proxy server is still running, there is no
need for stopping it.  See also <a
href="ch-configuration.html#s-gcconf">Configuration of garbage collection,
Section 4.2</a> and <a href="#s-maint">Smart Cache maintenance, Section
5.5</a>.

<hr>

<a name="s-maint"></a>
<h2>5.5 Smart Cache maintenance</h2>

<p>
Smart Cache needs no special maintenance except <a href="#s-gc">Running garbage
collection, Section 5.4</a> and maintaining some free diskspace.

<p>
In some rare cases (mainly due to improper cache shutdown) there can be some
orphan files (files without any reference) in the cache.  These can be located
and deleted using the <samp>java scache -killunref</samp> command or located
and inserted back into cache (by creating reference for them) by <samp>java
scache -repair</samp>.  These files are very rare and takes very few diskspace
(in most installations about 0.1%) , so there is no need to worry about them.

<p>
Nowadays these commands are obsolete and has been replaced by the garbage
collector, which happily deletes them as part of his normal operation.  Use
these commands only if you want to repair cache without performing garbage
collection.  This operation is about 2-3 times faster than garbage collection.

<p>
Repair procedures summary:
<ol type="1" start="1" >
<li>
if you are short of diskspace use -gc
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="2" >
<li>
if you are using -gc you need not to run something else
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="3" >
<li>
if you are want to recover inaccessible files run -repair
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="4" >
<li>
if you want to see what files will gc delete without deleting them use -fakegc.
Very handy for fine tuning GC.
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="5" >
<li>
do not use -killunref, it is just waste of time.  Repair or GC does much better
job.
</li>
</ol>

<a name="s-urlblock"></a>
<h2>5.6 URL blocking</h2>

<p>
Smart Cache has a builtin URL filter.  This filter was designed to eliminate
ADV.  banners, because they slow down browsing a lot, and other unwanted stuff
which WWW browsers downloads without asking (for example .AVI files in web
pages.  Netscape downloads it even if do not have plugin for them.).

<p>
Filter comes in two flavours normal dos-regexp and full-regexp.  Full regexp
filter has higher priority than normal and is configured in file
<samp>rfail.cnf</samp>.  Full regexp filter currently do not works with more
that one non comment line in rfail.cnf.

<p>
Normal filter in controlled by two <samp>fail.cnf</samp> and
<samp>pass.cnf</samp> configuration files.  In first file, you can find list of
BLOCKED URLs and list of UNBLOCKED in second.  Files has the same syntax -
write one URL mask per line, you can use wildchar '*' in expected way.  SC will
detects when you edit this files and reload it without needing to restart.

<p>
When SC got request for a particular URL, it will look in <samp>pass.cnf</samp>
first.  If requested URL is one of them, SC will skip following tests and
displays it.  If requested URL is not found in <samp>pass.cnf</samp> SC will
look into <samp>fail.cnf</samp>.  If requested URL is there, SC will abort
request otherwise request will be allowed.

<p>
When SC encounters a blocked URL, error <strong>403 Forbidden by rule</strong>
will be displayed.  You can display any custom URL instead, many people uses
some images, which will appear on places of ADV.  banners.  You can use any
picture from net, SC will cache this, so it will not be downloaded more times.

<pre>
     ErrorDocument 403 http://some.site.with.nice.images.com/images/nature/bluesky.gif
</pre>

<p>
Other people likes blank image instead.  Famous 43 byte long 1x1 transparent
GIF is now hardcoded in SC and can be used with:

<pre>
     ErrorDocument 403 0
</pre>

<p>
In some cases you may got unwanted <strong>Forbidden by rule</strong> errors.
You have two choices for their eliminating:
<ol type="1" start="1" >
<li>
You can locate URL mask which causes the URL blocking and remove it from the
file.  (<samp>trace_fail yes</samp> helps, if in trouble)
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="2" >
<li>
Because this URL masks blocks also what you want to block (for example ADV.
Banners), You can add new mask to <samp>pass.cnf</samp> file which unlock
incorrectly blocked URL.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
<strong>Example:</strong> You want to access site http://ad.astra.com/, but you
can't do that because Smart Cache has a default entry http://ad.* in
<code>fail.cnf</code> file, which deny access to this server.  You do not want
to remove this entry from <code>fail.cnf</code>, because it unlocks many ADV.
banners.  Solution is add http://ad.astra.* to <code>pass.cnf</code> file.

<p>
You can also turn of announcing blocked URLs to console by directive
<samp>trace_fail</samp>.  This is useful if you are using a complex
&quot;fail.cnf&quot; with a lot of entries and can't fiddle out if or why some
request has been blocked.

<h2>5.7 Smart Cache GUI</h2>

<p>
Smart Cache has a simple HTML user interface, which allows to search and browse
the cache content.  This UI is required if you want to use special offline
support features (hooks for Smart Cache Loader).  To enable it, add
<strong>ui_port 8081</strong> to <code>scache.cnf</code>.  After that point www
browser to http://127.0.0.1:8081/
