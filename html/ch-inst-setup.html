<h2>3.1 Smart Cache requires Java</h2>

<p>
Smart Cache is written in 100% pure Java, it does not uses or requires any
native or non-standard packages.  Smart Cache runs on any platform, which has
support for running compiled Java byte codes and has filesystem, which can use
long filenames.  To run Smart Cache your computer must be equipped with
something (often called java-runtime, jre or jdk), what is able to run Java 1.1
programs.  [<a href="footnotes.html#f1" name="fr1">1</a>]

<p>
Java may be already installed on your system [<a href="footnotes.html#f2"
name="fr2">2</a>] - type on command line <code>java</code> or <code>jre</code>
and see what happens.  If you got <em>Command not found</em> or <em>Bad command
or filename</em> error, you must download and install Java.  See following
sections for more informations about this topic.

<h2>3.2 Choosing Java version</h2>

<p>
There are several versions of Java available today, which are able to run Smart
Cache.  Older Java 1.1 and newer Java2 (also called JDK/JRE 1.2 or higher).
Smart Cache <strong>doesn't work</strong> [<a href="footnotes.html#f3"
name="fr3">3</a>] with old Java 1.0.X.

<p>
Java 1.2 is about 20% faster (more with HotSpot JVM) than Java1.1, but requires
much more memory (RAM) and is bigger for download.  I do not recommend running
Java 1.2 on computer with 32 or less MB of RAM.  This big memory footprint was
somewhat reduced in later Java 1.3 versions.

<p>
Java 1.4 (at least Win32 version, has not tried Unix port yet) was optimised
and eats just about the same small amount of memory as Java 1.1.

<p>
SUMMARY: If Smart Cache is only one Java program, which you are plan to use and
you do not plan to provide cache for large (10+) computer network, get Java1.1
because it is smaller for downloading and you will not get noticeable benefit
from later versions of Java except bug fixes.  If you have Win32 system and
download file size does not matter, get 1.4 version; it is a really nice and
stable.

<p>
Java comes with two flavour JDK or JRE.  JDK is intended for developers, who
needs to develop and compile Java programs.  JRE is for users, who wants just
to run them.  If you are not Java programmer, get JRE.  If you already have
JDK, you do not need to download JRE - JDK already contains it.  [<a

<h2>3.3 Java downloading</h2>

<p>
Java download links for Solaris and Windows95/98/NT users: <code><a
href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/index.html">JDK1.1</a></code>,
<code><a
href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/jre/index.html">JRE1.1</a></code>,
<code><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.3/">JDK1.3</a></code>.
General informations and download of Linux version of Java are at Blackdown's
<code><a href="http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux.html">Linux-Java</a></code>
page.

<p>
<code><a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a></code> has Java
runtime in package <code>jdk1.1</code>.  This package is in <em>non-free</em>
section, because they can not be distributed on CD's.  You can download it from
many <code><a href="http://www.debian.org/misc/README.mirrors">mirror
sites</a></code>.

<p>
Users of other operation systems or Linux distributions can find Java in
operation system itself.  Start installation program and look for
packages/programs named java, jdk, ...  or consult documentation which comes
with OS and follow instruction provided by OS vendor.  Also they can find
useful <code><a href="http://java.sun.com/cgi-bin/java-ports.cgi">this
page</a></code> which lists Java links for some less common operation systems.

<hr>

<a name="s-javainst"></a>
<h2>3.4 Checking the Java installation</h2>

<p>
Follow your operation system specific instruction for installing Java.  Some
installation comes with sample programs or applets, so you can try to run one
of them and look if Java works.

<p>
After installation <code>java</code> or <code>jre</code> command must work - It
displays list of available options.  If you get <em>Command not found</em> or
<em>Bad command or filename</em> error, your <var>PATH</var> environment
variable is not set correctly, locate these executable(s) and add it to
<var>PATH</var>.

<hr>

<a name="s-instdeb"></a>
<h2>3.5 Installation for Debian GNU/Linux users</h2>

<p>
For easy installation Smart Cache is distributed in Debian binary package
<code>scache</code> or <code>scache-native</code>.  You can get this package at
<code><a
href="http://home.tiscali.cz/~cz210552/deb/">http://home.tiscali.cz/~cz210552/deb/</a></code>
or by <code>apt</code> if you add following line to /etc/apt/sources.list

<pre>
     deb http://home.tiscali.cz/~cz210552/deb ./
</pre>

<p>
You can also create packages yourself by getting .tar.gz distribution and
running <samp>debian/rules binary</samp>.  Check file debian/control for
Build-Depends if you have installed required tools.  This script creates two
packages <code>scache</code> and <code>scache-native</code>.

<p>
Install this package and required package <code>jdk1.1</code> and optional
package <code>tya</code>.

<p>
See also <a href="ch-operating.html#s-run-debian">Smart Cache on Debian
GNU/Linux, Section 5.1</a> and do not forget <a
href="ch-configuration.html#s-inst-browser">Configuring a Web browser, Section
4.3</a>.

<h2>3.6 Generic installation from .zip file</h2>

<p>
After <a href="#s-javainst">Checking the Java installation, Section 3.4</a>,
for installing Smart Cache you must perform these steps:
<ul>
<li>
Unpack <code>scache.zip</code> into some empty directory.  A zip utility
supporting <strong>&quot;Long Names&quot; is required</strong>.  Info-Unzip or
Winzip are fine, but DOS version of PKZip is not.

<p>
Verify, that files have '.class' extension, not '.CLA' and file names are in
lower case.  Java is case-sensitive.  If not, you can have a bad unarchiver,
bad scache.zip or both.

<p>
Verify if your unpacker recreates archive directory structure when unarchiving.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
Copy provided sample *.cnf files from directory <em>samples</em> to upper
directory, which contains <code>.class</code> files.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Do not forget to <a href="ch-configuration.html#s-inst-browser">Configuring a
Web browser, Section 4.3</a>.
