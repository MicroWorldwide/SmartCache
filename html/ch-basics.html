Smart Cache Manual
<br>Chapter 2 - Basics information

<h2><a name="s2.1"></a>2.1 What is Smart Cache</h2>

<p>
Smart Cache is a full-featured HTTP proxy caching server and web forwarder
written entirely in 100% pure Java (Java 1.5 or later is required).  Smart
Cache was inspired by two most popular caches - modern Squid and older CERN
HTTP (IBM ported it to OS/2 called Internet Connection Server).  Smart Cache
gets only ideas from these programs, no source code is used.  Smart Cache has
been primarily written as a my <em>Personal Proxy Cache</em>.  This
<em>Personal Proxy Cache</em> is intended to replace your internal browser
cache and offers some extra features for allowing comfortable offline browsing.
</p>

<p>
After initial release, Smart Cache gets optimized, very configurable garbage
collection added, learned to do web forwarding/accelerator/transparent proxy
and turned into full-featured HTTP proxy server.
</p>

<h2><a name="s2.2"></a>2.2 Smart Cache summary</h2>

<p>
I have got a very nice following summary of Smart Cache's main features by
email.
</p>

<p>
<em>First I like to say you've done a great job with SCache.  It does not only
anonymize me, like many other programs, it's main feature, the cache, is a
great thing not only for speeding up surfing but also for offline browsing.  I
use it under OS/2 and under Windows without any problems.</em>
</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s-features"></a>2.3 Features List</h2>

<p>
Smart Cache can:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Block unwanted URLs.  What about blocking some adverts?  This makes browsing
much faster.  Try to block adverts at least on your favourite www servers and
see the difference.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Replace blocked adverts with your own images.  Quite interesting.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Blocking URL can be also used for blocking stats trackers
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
two kinds of Cookie filter for enhancing browsing privacy.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Referer URL filter for enhancing browsing privacy.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Redirect your browser to avoid multiple caching of the same WWW server.  For
example, if a WWW server has two aliases (www.netmag.cz and netmag.cz), you can
tell Smart Cache these are the same server!
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Redirect can make &quot;aliases&quot; for your favourite pages.  Try:
<samp>Redirect http://myhome/* http://www.geocities.com/blah/blah/*</samp>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Faster and better than internal browser cache; see <a
href="ch-intro.html#s-solutions">Other off line browsing solutions, Section
1.4</a>.  I recommend using Netscape and turning off disk cache while leaving a
small (about 2MB) memory cache.  This makes my Netscape significantly faster.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Share Internet Connection.  Connection to internet and cached files can be
shared between browsers and computers.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Because we use <em>CERN-style</em> methods for saving objects into cache, you
may easily look into cache and see what's in it.  You will see server names and
subdirectories.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Stored objects don't have any &quot;noise&quot; inside, like in other caches.
You may locate for example a .zip file stored in cache and immediately unpack
it to the desired location without needing removing HTTP headers like in other
caches (Squid, Apache).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>All types</strong> of documents including &quot;UNCACHEABLE&quot;
objects can be cached - like counters, etc.  Look for directive
<em>pragma_no_cache</em>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Optionally - If you press Stop in your browser, Smart Cache can still loads the
object into the cache.  So if you return to page later, you can see it
immediately loaded.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Great for downloading many small files via the browser without needing to apply
boring <em>Save as..</em> procedure to all.  Simply click on one - don't wait
for it be downloaded - and click on the next one.  After all objects have been
loaded, you can locate them in the cache and copy/move them to your desired
directory or you may click on them in your browser.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Smart Cache works even if you are off line and simulates Internet connection
quite good.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
You will not see any difference between on-line and off line browsing.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Smart Cache is fully transparent, you will not have any problems with updating
off line cached pages.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Smart Cache do not run garbage collection when it wants.  Until you run garbage
collection by hand, you are sure that all previously seen web pages are also on
your hard drive.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Very configurable garbage collection.  You can decide what pages are important
for you and you Smart Cache keeps it in cache longer.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Damaged cache can be repaired without losing all cached data.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
HTML User interface for searching and configuring.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Download manager integration.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Data compression support for saving diskspace.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Web grabber integration, mark pages when offline and download them later.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
HTTP/1.1 persistent connection support for better browsing performance.  Note
that incoming and outgoing persistent connections are independent.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
