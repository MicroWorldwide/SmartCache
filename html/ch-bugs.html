<h2><a name="s-dnsbug"></a>12.1 Java DNS caching bug/feature</h2>

<p>
Java (at least 1.1 and 1.2 versions, see notes for Java 1.3 setup) caches for
security and performance reasons <strong>every</strong> DNS response received.
This has two negative side effects:
</p>
<ol type="1" start="1" >
<li>
<p>
Java never performs garbage collection on it's internal DNS cache.  After weeks
of continual use of Smart Cache this eats too much memory.  It's recommended
restart Smart Cache after some time (for example every 3rd day) of continual
using to clean internal DNS cache of Java virtual machine.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="2" >
<li>
<p>
Java caches <strong>every</strong> response.  DNS servers sends three types of
response: Authoritative, Non-Authoritative (cached data) and Server failed.  If
you are not connected to Internet, you will get server failed responses,
because server can't check the DNS name.  When Java virtual machine gets this
response from operation system, it interprets it as <em>Bad hostname</em> and
stores into internal cache.  This is implementation bug in current Java
versions.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
This <strong>does not causes any problems</strong> if you are <strong>always
connected to Internet</strong> (or at least your DNS server is), but causes
problems if you are browsing off line, start a Internet connection and continue
to browsing on line.  This bug causes that pages on servers, which you visited
off line, will not be refreshed and new pages will not be loaded from these
servers.
</p>

<p>
Example session: You start Smart Cache at system boot time.  Later you start
browsing www.yahoo.com, for example.  After some time, you decided to connect
to Internet and continue browsing.  Smart Cache will report <em>Host
Unknown</em> error about www.yahoo.com even if you are connected to Internet.
</p>

<p>
You can avoid this bug by using one of these solutions:
</p>
<ol type="1" start="1" >
<li>
<p>
Best solution is <strong>If you are using Java 1.3</strong> add
<samp>-Dsun.net.inetaddr.ttl=0</samp> option to command line, before word
<code>scache</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="2" >
<li>
<p>
<strong>Restart the cache</strong> if you were browsing off line and (after
establishing connection to your ISP) then want to browse online.  It is not
necessary to (re)start Smart Cache if you are connected to Internet - only no
off line browsing activity after start is important.  Web browser restart is
not required.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="3" >
<li>
<p>
Good solution is <strong>use your ISP's proxy</strong> server, which also
speed-up the web access speed.  Parent (ISP's) proxy is defined in
<code>scache.cnf</code> file by directive <code>http_proxy</code>.  But this
server <strong>MUST BE</strong> entered using his numeric <em>IP address</em>,
not the hostname!  This also solves problem with Java's growing DNS caches.
</p>

<p>
If you are using hostname, this bug will not be defeated.  When SC starts and
can not resolve http_proxy hostname (not connected to Internet), http_proxy
will be ignored.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
