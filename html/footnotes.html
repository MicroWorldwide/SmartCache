Smart Cache Manual

<h2><a href="ch-inst-setup.html#fr1" name="f1">1</a></h2>

<p>
JDK1.1, JRE1.1 or JDK1.2, JRE1.2 are such programs.  There are also some Open
Source alternatives, such as <code><a
href="http://www.kaffe.org/">Kaffe</a></code> or <code><a
href="http://www.japhar.org/">Japhar</a></code>.

<h2><a href="ch-inst-setup.html#fr2" name="f2">2</a></h2>

<p>
Some operations system, such as many Linux distributions or OS/2 Warp, comes
with bundled Java.  Newer web browsers (Netscape 2+ and Microsoft Internet
Explorer 3+) has embedded Java, but because this Java is unable to operate
outside web browser's environment, it can not be used to run Smart Cache.

<h2><a href="ch-inst-setup.html#fr3" name="f3">3</a></h2>

<p>
It is not impossible to made a Java-1.0 compatible version.  Only Java 1.1
features, which Smart Cache uses, are Date format stuff, CRC32, Socket Linger
and Timeout options.

<h2><a href="ch-inst-setup.html#fr4" name="f4">4</a></h2>

<p>
Upgrade pack from JRE to full JDK is not available in Sun distribution.  Debian
GNU/Linux uses can perform upgrade by installing package
<code>jdk1.1-dev</code>.

<h2><a href="ch-operating.html#fr5" name="f5">5</a></h2>

<p>
Many people found that just deleting entire cache directory by hand is easier
for them.

<h2><a href="ch-admins.html#fr6" name="f6">6</a></h2>

<p>
I simply do not understand why Squid documentation writes that using
transparent proxy can open new security hole.

<h2><a href="ch-troubles.html#fr7" name="f7">7</a></h2>

<p>
Some versions of JRE/JAVA gives more detailed error messages.  If you get
something like <samp>Port is already in use</samp> look at 1 or 2.  If you get
<samp>Not a local address</samp> look at 3 or 4.

<h2><a href="ch-troubles.html#fr8" name="f8">8</a></h2>

<p>
Some people tries to set up transparent proxy when using <em>BindAddress</em>
with wildcard for example <samp>BindAddress 192.168.*.*</samp>.  <strong>There
are wrong.</strong> Transparent proxy requires special TCP/IP setup, not Smart
Cache's setup.  See <a href="ch-admins.html#s-transparent">Using Smart Cache as
transparent proxy, Section 9.8</a>.

<h2><a href="ch-troubles.html#fr9" name="f9">9</a></h2>

<p>
Older SmartCache has in default config files browser faking enabled.  I never
notice it, but this was reported by some users and removing browser faking
solves this problem.

<h2><a href="ch-troubles.html#fr10" name="f10">10</a></h2>

<p>
Ignoring reload requests is a great thing for web-forwarders and for increasing
productivity in office (WEB-CHAT-style pages will stops work; There are quite
useless if users can't reload every XX minutes.  Also I find, that many users
are bored in work and do not have anything other things to do than pressing
Reload on their favourite servers every 10 minutes).

<h2><a href="ch-faq.html#fr11" name="f11">11</a></h2>

<p>
SC need Java but JDK can not be distributed in the same way as SC.  You must
include JRE instead, which can be redistributed without problems.

<h2><a href="ch-faq.html#fr12" name="f12">12</a></h2>

<p>
It is interesting that many users reported to me that SC is faster than Squid,
after their switched.  I have a very few experience with Squid now.

<h2><a href="ch-old.html#fr13" name="f13">13</a></h2>

<p>
Because I am lazy programmer, my registration number check was very easy.  It
considers everything what's begins with <em>HTTP</em> as good registration
number.  I have fun to giving everybody (for free) who ask for serial number
horrible long numbers such as
<samp>HTTP-CACHE-3122578-Hwrd734-bvfdrt4365-3234343</samp>.  Nobody ever
noticed that Smart Cache works even with 'bad' numbers.
