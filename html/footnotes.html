Smart Cache Manual
<br>Footnotes</h1>

<h2><a href="ch-inst-setup.html#fr1" name="f1">1</a></h2>

<p>
JDK 5, JDK 1.5, JRE 5, JRE 1.5, Java SE 5, Java SE 6 are such programs.  There
are also some Open Source alternatives, such as <code><a
href="http://icedtea.classpath.org/">IcedTea</a></code>, <code><a
href="http://harmony.apache.org/">Apache Harmony</a></code>, or <code><a
href="http://openjdk.java.net/">Open JDK</a></code>.
</p>

<h2><a href="ch-inst-setup.html#fr2" name="f2">2</a></h2>

<p>
Some operations system, such as many Linux distributions or preinstalled
Windows, comes with bundled Java.
</p>

<h2><a href="ch-inst-setup.html#fr3" name="f3">3</a></h2>

<p>
Upgrade pack from JRE to full JDK is not available in Sun distribution.  Debian
GNU/Linux uses can perform JRE to JDK upgrade simply by installing
<strong>-jdk</strong> package such as <code>sun-java5-jdk</code>.
</p>

<h2><a href="ch-operating.html#fr4" name="f4">4</a></h2>

<p>
Many people found that just deleting entire cache directory by hand is easier
for them.  It can be tricky on Windows, because Smart Cache is creating long
path names and windows explorer (standard gui shell) cant delete very long path
names.
</p>

<h2><a href="ch-admins.html#fr5" name="f5">5</a></h2>

<p>
I simply do not understand why Squid documentation writes that using
transparent proxy can open new security hole.
</p>

<h2><a href="ch-troubles.html#fr6" name="f6">6</a></h2>

<p>
Some versions of JRE/JAVA gives more detailed error messages.  If you get
something like <samp>Port is already in use</samp> look at 1 or 2.  If you get
<samp>Not a local address</samp> look at 3 or 4.
</p>

<h2><a href="ch-troubles.html#fr7" name="f7">7</a></h2>

<p>
Some people tries to set up transparent proxy when using <em>BindAddress</em>
with wildcard for example <samp>BindAddress 192.168.*.*</samp>.  <strong>There
are wrong.</strong> Transparent proxy requires special TCP/IP setup, not Smart
Cache's setup.  See <a href="ch-admins.html#s-transparent">Using Smart Cache as
transparent proxy, Section 9.8</a>.
</p>

<h2><a href="ch-troubles.html#fr8" name="f8">8</a></h2>

<p>
Older SmartCache has in default config files browser faking enabled.  I never
notice it, but this was reported by some users and removing browser faking
solves this problem.
</p>

<h2><a href="ch-troubles.html#fr9" name="f9">9</a></h2>

<p>
Ignoring reload requests is a great thing for web-forwarders and for increasing
productivity in office (WEB-CHAT-style pages will stops work; There are quite
useless if users can't reload every XX minutes.  Also I find, that many users
are bored in work and do not have anything other things to do than pressing
Reload on their favourite servers every 10 minutes).
</p>

<h2><a href="ch-faq.html#fr10" name="f10">10</a></h2>

<p>
SC need Java but JDK can not be distributed in the same way as SC.  You must
include JRE instead, which can be redistributed without problems.
</p>

<h2><a href="ch-faq.html#fr11" name="f11">11</a></h2>

<p>
It is interesting that many users reported to me that SC is faster than Squid,
after their switched.  I have a very few experience with Squid now.
</p>

<h2><a href="ch-old.html#fr12" name="f12">12</a></h2>

<p>
Because I am lazy programmer, my registration number check was very easy.  It
considers everything what's begins with <em>HTTP</em> as good registration
number.  I have fun to giving everybody (for free) who ask for serial number
horrible long numbers such as
<samp>HTTP-CACHE-3122578-Hwrd734-bvfdrt4365-3234343</samp>.  Nobody ever
noticed that Smart Cache works even with 'bad' numbers.
</p>
